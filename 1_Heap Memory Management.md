# Heap Memory Management - Goals and Introduction üåêüõ†Ô∏èüìö

1. **Heap Memory in Linux**
    - A continuous part of the 
      - virtual address space used for 
      - dynamic memory allocation during a process‚Äôs runtime.
      - Utilizes the GLibc API (standard C library) to manage and manipulate heap memory.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
    - The process known as claiming and reclaiming memory during runtime, managed by utilizing particular system calls and APIs.
    
3. **APIs for Heap Memory Management**
    - `malloc` and `calloc`: Allocate a block of memory from the heap segment.(`not system calls but glibc API`)
    - `free`: Releases the claimed memory back to the heap segment.
    - `realloc`: Reallocate memory with a new size, keeping existing content.
    - Note: These are not system calls, but APIs provided by the standard C library.
    
4. **System Calls Related to Heap Memory**
    - `brk` and `sbrk`: System calls provided by Linux to manage the heap memory segment.

5. **Memory Fragmentation**
    - Internal fragmentation within heap memory by the Linux OS is an issue that arises and needs effective management.
    - Solutions and discussions around fragmentation issues and related system calls.
    
6. **Programmer's Responsibility**
    - Unlike stack memory, in heap memory, it's the programmer's responsibility to free dynamically allocated memory.

# Curiosity ü§î

1. **What is Heap Memory?**
   - How is heap memory different from stack memory in the context of memory management?

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Can you explain the primary differences and use-cases between `malloc` and `calloc`?
   - How does `realloc` manage existing data during reallocation?

3. **Memory Fragmentation**
   - Can you delve into the problems caused by memory fragmentation in heap memory?
   - What are some solutions or strategies to mitigate internal fragmentation in heap memory?

4. **APIs vs System Calls**
   - Why are `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` considered APIs and not system calls?
   - How do system calls like `brk` and `sbrk` interact with heap memory, and when are they utilized?

5. **Memory Management Responsibility**
   - What issues might arise if a programmer fails to responsibly manage dynamically allocated memory?

### # Concepts in Simple Words üìò

1. **Heap Memory**
   - Think of heap memory like a big pool of memory space that programs can use to get extra memory while they are running. It is super useful when they need more memory than was originally set aside for them.

2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Imagine you are hosting a party, and you rent chairs (memory). Using `malloc` or `calloc`, you decide how many chairs you need (allocate memory). Once the party ends, you have to return the chairs, so others can use them. That‚Äôs where `free` comes in - to give back the memory you don't need anymore.

3. **APIs and System Calls**
   - APIs like `malloc` and system calls like `sbrk` are like team leaders that help in managing this heap memory pool effectively. APIs are kind of like guidelines or tools for managing memory, while system calls work more deeply, directly talking to the computer's operating system to manage memory.

4. **Memory Fragmentation**
   - Fragmentation is like having little empty spaces (unusable) scattered across your memory pool because of how memory was used and then returned. It's a problem because it can waste memory and make the system slower, so developers try to minimize it for efficient performance.

Remember: Manage your heap memory well, and always ensure to free up memory that‚Äôs no longer needed, to keep everything running smoothly! üöÄüë®‚Äçüíª
